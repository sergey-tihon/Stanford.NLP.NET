summary
    Stanford Parser
description
    A natural language parser is a program that works out the grammatical structure of sentences, for instance, which groups of words go together (as \"phrases\") and which words are the subject or object of a verb. Probabilistic parsers use knowledge of language gained from hand-parsed sentences to try to produce the most likely analysis of new sentences.
